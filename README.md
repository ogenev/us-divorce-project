# What is the Likelihood that American Actors, Singers and Politicians Divorce? - Analyzing Wikipedia Data

In this project, we'll aim to find the likelihood of a divorce among American actors and actresses, singers and politicians and compare the results for each group.

We'll analyze existing data from 14461 profiles on Wikipedia and we'll try to answer the following questions:

1. What is the likelihood of a divorce among US actors? Is there any difference between actors and actresses?
2. Do actors with Academy Award (Oscar) are more likely to divorce?
3. How that rate compare to US politicians and singers?

### Summary of Results

After analyzing the data, the conclusions we reached are:

* The likelihood of a divorce among all US actors is 34,7%
* US actresses are more likely to divorce compared to US actors.
* Academy Award winners are almost two times more likely to get a divorce compared to all US actors.
* US politicians likelihood of a divorce is very low - only 2,8%
